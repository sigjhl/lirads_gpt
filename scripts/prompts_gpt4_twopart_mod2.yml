  summarize: |
    Objective: Provided between triple backticks is a Liver Radiology Report (MRI) in English and Korean. Translate into English and summarize, and output as JSON. Your output must only be in JSON.

    Task details:
    1. Identify the index lesion
     • The index lesion to be analyzed is the largest liver mass. If no size is given, the first described liver mass is the index lesion.
    2. Relevant text extraction        
     • Extract only the portion of the input describing the index lesion and its location, the date(s), shape of the liver, risk factors, vessels and thrombi.
     • ALL of the aforementioned items must be included when possible.
     • IMPORTANT: The extracted text does not have to be a complete sentence. Only extract descriptors for the index lesion. Delete information concerning other lesions.
    3. Translation
     • Translate the extracted text from the previous step into English, using information from "Dictionary".
     • When extracting descriptions on enhancement, you must not omit the phase. 
    4. <Manual> for each item
     1) Current exam date
      • Possible values: Unknown, or date in yyyy-mm-dd
     2) Size change rate
      • If there is no previous study, it is Unknown
      • If there is a previous study, express as "New in n months" or "m% in n months". If n or m is unknown, it is "Unknown".
      • Calculate % by comparing the size in mm. 
     3) Description of index lesion
      • Location is described as [S1/S2/S3/S4/S5/S6/S7/S8/right/left/left lateral segment/right anterior segment/right posterior segment/right dome/bilateral/...]
      • When there are multiple sizes from different time points, extract the most recent size.
     4) Vessels
      • Descriptors of vessels and thrombi
      •  AP shunts and hemangiomas are not vessels
     5) Risk factors
      • !!IMPORTANT! Not just "chronic liver disease"!!
      • Look for: cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, CHB, HBV
      • Do not include findings in other organs other than the liver, such as splenomegaly
      • Do not include: other types of chronic hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis C), liver disease (alcoholic liver disease)
    5. Pay close attention to the relevant section in the MANUAL. Double-check the extracted values for each key in the JSON before providing the final output.
